    "We noted in the [previous section](../01_HelloWorld/01_HelloWorld) that Python can act most trivially as a calculator.  Of course, if this were all that Python could do, it would not be a very useful language!  Instead, the way that Python and most other programming languages move beyond simple operations is via the use of **variables**, which allow us to store and manipulate data more abstractly.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables operate very similar to the variables you may know from algebra: they are symbols that stand for a specific piece of data, and they can be manipulated abstractly (ignoring the specific values of the data) or evaluated explicitly (plugging in the data values).  Thinking of variables as analogous to those in math class can be useful.\n",

You have already seen this, but once a cell has been executed, any variables that have been assigned or updated in that cell have also been assigned or updated in the workspace of *all other cells* in the notebook *even those above* that cell!  As a result, it is strongly recommended that your logical flow move downward through the notebook.  Use the print function *liberally* to make sure everything is working as you expect (you can always delete them once you're sure everything's ok).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes, thing will break or become confusing or messy.  Or maybe you're not sure whether you've defined a variable correctly above or below a new cell.  In this case, you should turn to the **Kernel** menu at the top toolbar.  There you will see several very useful options, especially **interrupt** and **restart**.  If something is taking too long (or forever), you can use interrupt to stop Python from continuing to execute, *interrupting* Python wherever it currently is in your code.  Less drastically, but also useful, you can use restart and its variants to clear away everything you've done and start the notebook over in terms of variable assignments but while keeping the code you've written.  This is a good way to make sure that your logical flow works (restart & run all) or to clean up your notebook before sharing (please do this before turning in notebooks for homework!).\n",

Comments do not affect how your code runs, but they are **imperative** for how your code is used, both by others and your *future* self.  You can also use them while working through broken code to discover bugs by \"commenting out\" lines of code by placing a `#` at the beginning of the lines and then \"uncommenting\" them one by one until you find the part that's breaking.

    "## A Few Notes about Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "With a few exceptions, you can use any set of connected alphanumeric characters (and the underscore, `_`) to name your variables.  As a result, you may be tempted to use `x` and `y` as in math class.  This is not advised!  The flexibility of variable names means that you should err on the side of *descriptiveness* over brevity.  If you are calculating the length of bird's beaks, name your variable `beak_lens`.  If you calculate the mean, save it as `mean_beak_len`.  This may seem tedious, but space (in memory and on the screen) is cheap, and the description will help you and others know what your code is doing.  Furthermore, Jupyter (and many other Python IDEs) have **tab-completion** meaning that at any point in typing you can hit the `tab` button and a drop-down menu will populate with variables and functions that could complete the word you've already started, meaning that long variables take just as long as short ones!  (This also greatly diminishes typos!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The only real constraint you might encounter on variable names are that they can't contain non-alphanumeric characters or the underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and `_` only) and that they can't start with a number.  (You *can* start a variable with `_`.  In Python it is convention that variables that start with an underscore are **private** variables, which are not meant to be accessed by an end user.  You don't need to worry about this, I just want to point it out in case you see such a variable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names are **case-sensitive**!  `Var` is different from `var` is different from `vAR` is different from `VAR`.  As a result, don't use capitalization to distinguish variables!

    "\n",
    "You've already seen variables holding these data types in action, and they largely operate as you'd expect.  We only note that because computers have finite memory, they can only store numbers to a finite precision.  Typically, Python uses 32 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) to store integers, meaning that the integer type can represent any integer from $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$ because it has one bit to indicate whether the integer is positive or negative and then 31 leftover 0's and 1's.  Similarly, floats use 64 bits, so that they can represet $2^{64}$ numbers between $\\pm 6.02\\times 10^{23}$.  As a result, there are some (most) decimals that cannot be perfectly represented by your computer, which can result in [roundoff error](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RoundoffError.html), which can be a big problem in numerical calculations.  In practice, this means that you might see that Python returns 0.30000000000000004 when you enter `print(3 * 0.1)` instead of 0.3, as you hoped.  This error is $4\\times 10^{-16}$, which can be negigible in most applications."

The order in which they are inserted into the string is inferred from the order they are given to `format` or by a number indicating which input to put where (0 indicates the first input, 1 the second, etc.).  I prefer f-strings because they are the most concise, but all of these are equally valid by Python.

Methods are the latter type.  Going forward, you will see both types of funtions, but you can always think of them as input-output relationships: they take some input, crank a wheel, and spit something out.
