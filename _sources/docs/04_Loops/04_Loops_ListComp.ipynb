    "The loops presented in the previous part of this chapter are fundamental operations that are common in most programming languages. Their syntax and usage at this point is hopefully somewhat simple to understand, and you can get by perfectly well using them in 99\\% of situations.  However, in Python, there is a somewhat odd way of wrapping up the `for` loop structure into a list as a method for easily creating a list that contains the results of simple calculations performed in an iteration.\n",
