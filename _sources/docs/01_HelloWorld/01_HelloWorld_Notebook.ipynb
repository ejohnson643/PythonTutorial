    "To begin your Python journey, open a new Jupyter notebook, either from the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator) or from the [command line](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#optional-launch-spyder-or-jupyter-notebook-from-the-command-line) (for beginners, I strongly recommend the Navigator).  Recall that once you have launched the Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator (or command line), it will bring you to the Notebook Dashboard, where you can open a new notebook by selecting ``New -> Python 3`` from the dropdown menu on the top right.  Your new notebook should look something like this:\n",

    "Congratulations!  If all has gone well, you have now executed your first Python command and your computer has greeted the world!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, this is all there is to programming: you type some commands, hit ``shift + enter``, and something happens!  In Jupyter we use the cells to break up the code into chunks and we can execute those chunks independently.  We'll explore this more shortly, but you should test this yourself by typing something else into the new cell that popped up (Try ``print(\"Hello Computer!\")``).\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty then comes in learning Python's commands and syntax in order to put down code that means something.  The [`print`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) command that you just entered is an example of a Python **function**.  Functions are ubiquitous in Python as they are how we wrap up useful actions like [`sum`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum) to add up numbers or [`sorted`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) to put items in order.  We'll learn all about Python's builtin functions and in [section 7](../06_Functions/06_Functions), you will learn to write your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the syntax for a Python function is ``func(args)``, where the function ``func`` takes in ``args`` as inputs.  The inputs to a function are called **arguments**, hence the name ``args``.  The ``func`` function then does some prescribed actions involving ``args`` to do something.  The parentheses indicate that you are invoking ``func`` on the stuff inside the parentheses (``args``), and if you see this syntax - ``something_new(some_stuff)``, for example - you can safely assume that ``something_new`` is a function.  This is your first introduction to Python's **syntax**, i.e. its \"grammar\", for how we tell it to do things.  Getting a handle on syntax is something that will come with time, but I'll try to point it out whenever something new is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, another very useful function is the `help` function.  If you discover a new function, you can feed it to `help` as an input (``help(mystery_func)``) and the function's **documentation** will be shown.  Part of the Python ethos is to strongly encourage documentation of everything, and there are [guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) for how they should be written so that you can always follow along."

    "\n",
    "In the case of ``print(\"Hello World!\")``, the input is ``\"Hello World!\"`` and the ``print`` function \"prints\" the input to the screen, which is why we see ``Hello World`` below the first cell.  In general, Python does not display everything to the user, so the [`print`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function is a **SUPER USEFUL** way to keep track of what is going on in your code.  Throughout this tutorial, we will liberally use [`print`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) to make sure that we know what is going on in our codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see shortly, Jupyter notebooks automatically \"print\" the last line of any cell, making ``print`` somewhat redundant, but since we'll often want to look at more than one thing per cell, we'll keep [`print`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) at the top of the toolbox."
