    "# Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've learned about how data are stored in Python as different types that we can collect into [data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) like [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/list.html) or [numpy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html), we should learn how to actually *do* things with our data! The next three sections on **loops**, [conditional statements](../05_ConditionalStatements/05_ConditionalStatements_Notebook), and [functions](../06_Functions/06_Functions_Notebook) will comprise the basics of everything you need to get yourself up and running with Python. This will also be your first introduction to Python's **syntax** (its \"grammar\" for how to structure code), beyond the simple syntax of variable assignment that we've seen thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops** are a natural place to start in the context of thinking about Python for data analysis because loops are a coding structure that tell computers how to execute a set of instructions repeatedly, and we often have lists or arrays of data that we want to iterate through (\"loop over\" in coding lingo) to perform calculations on each datum individually. That is, the term \"loop\" refers to the way that the computer *loops back* to do a set of tasks many times. This is one of the true superpowers of coding: computers have infinite patience and can do boring tasks repeatedly *ad nauseam*, so we can leverage this to make calculations or perform analyses that would be impossible to do by hand. We'll talk about this more when we learn about [random number generation](../10_RandomNumbers/10_RandomNumbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python there are three main types of loops: [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement), [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while), and [**list comprehensions**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions). `for` loops are probably the most common type and are the easiest to work with. `while` loops have a similar syntax to `for` loops, but are somewhat trickier and are a common source of bugs for novice coders. Finally, list comprehensions have a more complicated syntax, but are extremely \"[Pythonic](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pythonic.htm)\" and a nice way to compress loops that involve lists. In this tutorial, we'll mostly focus on `for` and `while` loops, but I'll introduce the list comprehension syntax so that you aren't stumped when you see it in the wild.  In this section, we'll learn about `for` loops, and we'll leave `while` loops for the next section, after we've introduced the notion of [conditional statements](../05_ConditionalStatements/05_ConditionalStatements_Notebook).\n",

    "\n",
    "At its most basic, a computer is a [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)-moving and -storing machine; it can remember information and it can modify that information, but it at some level operates in a discrete, bit-by-bit manner. I say this because it can seem as though computers are doing many things simultaneously, but under the hood, operations like `sum([1, 12, 3, 6, 321])` are carried out by the computer as a set of *very fast*, simple, sequential steps:\n",
    "- Set `tmp_sum = 0`\n",
    "- `tmp_sum = tmp_sum + 1`\n",
    "- `tmp_sum = tmp_sum + 12`\n",
    "- `tmp_sum = tmp_sum + 3`\n",
    "- `tmp_sum = tmp_sum + 6`\n",
    "- `tmp_sum = tmp_sum + 321`\n",
    "- return `tmp_sum` to the user.\n",
    "The `for` loop is our structure to control this iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a `for` loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind a `for` loop is that we are filling in the sentence \"Do these steps *for* this many iterations.\" That is, we know how many times we want to do the operations, so the computer should do them for all the indicated repetitions. In Python, this is done by iterating over an **iterable** such as a list or array (tautologically, iterables are things that can be iterated over).\n",
