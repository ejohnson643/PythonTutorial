Functions require a bit of abstract thought in this way, so it is helpful to stay grounded by thinking about what you are putting into the function and what you would like to get out.

For example, when we call `nice_add(1, 2)`, Python knows to assign the temporary variables `x=1` and `y=2` because 1 is the first input and 2 is the second. If we create a function with 10 positional arguments, then when we call the function, we need to provide these inputs in the correct order to maintain the correct variable assignment within the function.  This also means that if we define a function with $N$ positional arguments, then $N$ inputs must be provided whenever calling this function to avoid a `TypeError`.  Try calling `nice_add(1)` to see what this looks like."

    "At this point, we now have all the tools to completely understand the documentation of different functions such as [`np.sum`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html), which is introduced as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block}\n",

    "### Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this however, is usually a breakdown of all the details of the function, such as descriptions of what the inputs and outputs are and examples of how the function should be used.  When writing your own functions, it is good practice to provide this documentation (at least in part) to remind yourself and others what your function does and how it should be used.  This is naturally done in Python with a [**docstring**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) (\"documentation string\"), which is a special message that you can include after the first line of your function definition (after the `def myfunc(inputs):` line) to provide more information on your function.  Providing this docstring means that whenever you use the `help` function on your function it will print this docstring to the screen.  For example, using `help(np.sum)` provides the same information as we can find at the [link](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html) included earlier."

    "1. In a fashion similar to `nicer_add`, write a function `nice_arithmetic` that formats basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) nicely. Use a keyword to allow the user to specify the operator they would like to use, and use another keyword to allow the user to toggle between printing symbols and plain english (i.e. between \"1 + 2 = 3\" and \"The sum of 1 and 2 is 3\"). Return the computation as output, and test your function on several examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the following pseudocode to define a function integrate that performs simple integration of a function over a range (recall that integration is simply finding the area under a curve).\n",
    "    - Set as inputs: the function to integrate, `f`, the endpoints of the interval, `a`, and `b`, as well as the number of steps to use in approximation `n` (you may use a default number here).\n",
    "    - Check that `a` < `b` and that `n` is a positive integer. If either of these conditions are not met, print what is wrong and use return with no output to quit the function.\n",
    "    - Calculate `dx = (b - a)/n`, the width of each approximating rectangle.\n",
    "    - Set `left_pt = a`, `right_pt = a + dx`, `sum = 0`\n",
    "    - While `right_pt` is less than or equal to `b` do the following:\n",
    "        - Find the average of `f` at `left_pt` and `right_pt`, multiply by `dx` to approximate the area of the rectangle under the function `f` between `left_pt` and `right_pt`.\n",
    "        - Add the result of this calculation to `sum`.\n",
    "        - Increment `left_pt` and `right_pt` by `dx` to examine the next rectangle.\n",
    "    - Print the value of the integral (show the given endpoints and the number of approximating rectangles)\n",
    "    - Return the output\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test your function using `np.cos` and `a=0`, `b=1` for various values of `n`. (As `n` increases, your function should return a number closer to 0.841470984807897.) If you have any issues, try this [wikipedia reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration), then try this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCPWtXVyzFg) if you are still having trouble. Note that the video is not exactly the same protocol as I have given here, so you will need to make appropriate adjustments.\n",

The last few sections are also useful enough that I cannot omit them from an introductory tutorial, although you can get by without learning about [dictionaries](../09_Dictionaries/09_Dictionaries_Notebook), [classes](11_Classes/11_Classes_Notebook), and [random number generators](10_RandomNumbers/10_RandomNumbers_Notebook) if you need to, but if you are taking my [*What Do Your Data Say?*](https://ejohnson643.github.io/WhatDoYourDataSay) course, you will need to learn about random number generation in Python."
